# Tutorial on R language

### Bit About R

R is a powerful and widely-used programming language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It provides a vast array of statistical and graphical techniques, making it popular among statisticians and data scientists for data analysis, visualization, and modeling. R's extensive package ecosystem allows users to access additional functionality for specialized tasks, further enhancing its flexibility and utility in diverse domains such as academia, industry, and research.

### Introduction

You can use this tutorial in one or two ways, as a visual guide or as a hands on guide. Either way, I recommend you clone this repository so that you can have your own copy to work with.  

To clone the repository follow these simple steps:  

- Open Terminal 
- (Within terminal) Go to the location (File) where you want to clone this repository 
- Run `git clone https://github.com/shashkat/libraries.git` 

This will create a libraries folder in the current directory, within which there will be a R_tutorial folder. You basically now have a copy of this whole repository locally in your computer. All the files in this tutorial (eg: R_tutorial/getting_started_basic_coding_and_arithmetic.R) can be run locally in your computer now.

### Installation

It would be recommended to install R followed by Rstudio to follow this tutorial to the best.

Both of these installations' latest versions and corresponding installation instructions can be found by visiting: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/

### Tutorial

One can just follow along the different .R files in this directory. The comments in the file indicate the specifics of each command.

The files can be followed in this sequence, though to the most extent the content is not very dependepdent on the files preceeding any file.

- getting_started_basic_coding_and_arithmetic.R
- vectors_and_matrices.R
- importing_and_exporting_data.R
- working_with_data.R
- subsetting_data.R
- logic_commands.R

It would be better to clone this repository and then run the .R files in Rstudio. Setting the working directory as the base folder of this repo (the libraries folder) would work best. To clone the repository, open terminal and go to the location where you want to clone this repo, and run `git clone https://github.com/shashkat/libraries.git`
