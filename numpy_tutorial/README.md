# Tutorial on NumPy

NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful library in Python that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

### Installation

It would be recommended to first create a conda environment and within that, install numpy.

To install numpy, type in terminal: `pip install numpy`, or simply run the cell in the notebook with the install command (if using conda environment, ensure that while running the notebook, the kernel corresponding to that conda environment is selected).

### Tutorial

One can just follow along the main.ipynb file in this directory. The comments in the file indicate the specifics of each command.

It would be better to clone this repository and then run the main.ipynb locally. To clone the repository, open terminal and go to the location where you want to clone this repo, and run `git clone https://github.com/shashkat/libraries.git`
