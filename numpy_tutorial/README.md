# Tutorial on NumPy

### Bit About Numpy

NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful library in Python that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

### Introduction

You can use this tutorial in one or two ways, as a visual guide or as a hands on guide. Either way, I recommend you clone this repository so that you can have your own copy to work with.  

To clone the repository follow these simple steps:  

- Open Terminal 
- (Within terminal) Go to the location (File) where you want to clone this repository 
- Run `git clone https://github.com/shashkat/libraries.git` 

This will create a libraries folder in the current directory, within which there will be a numpy_tutorial folder. You basically now have a copy of this whole repository locally in your computer. The main.ipynb file (libraries/numpy_tutorial/main.ipynb) can be run locally on your computer now.

### Installation

It would be recommended to first create a conda environment and within that, install numpy.

To install numpy, type in terminal: `pip install numpy`, or simply run the cell in the notebook with the install command (it is in the first cell of the Install and Import section). If using conda environment, ensure that while running the notebook, the kernel corresponding to that conda environment is selected.

### Tutorial

One can just follow along the **main.ipynb** file in this directory. The comments in the file indicate the specifics of each command.

It would be better to clone this repository and then run the main.ipynb locally. To clone the repository, open terminal and go to the location where you want to clone this repo, and run `git clone https://github.com/shashkat/libraries.git`
